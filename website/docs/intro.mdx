Quick Test CLI is a project to perform stress tests in competitive programming in an easy and fast way so that you can focus only on the contest.

This project was inspired after watching the following screencasts: [1v1 Coding | 2020 Lockout Championship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABbBGtEWks&t=1434s) and [How to test your solution in Competitive Programming, on Linux?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXTVOyQpSGM) Made by [Errichto](https://codeforces.com/profile/Errichto) some time ago.

### What Quick Test CLI provides vs. the traditional way of performing stress testing?

* Multi-platform
* Supports several languages
* Friendly user interface
* You don't have to create or use tedious bash scripts
* It can be a standard for the community
* It is a collaborative project that can continue to grow for the benefit of the competitive programming community.
