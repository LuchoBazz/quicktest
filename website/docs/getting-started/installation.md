## Known Issues

### unzip is required

The program [`unzip`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/unzip) is a requirement for the Shell installer.

```sh
$ curl -fsSL https://luismbaezco.github.io/quicktest/install/install.sh | sh
Error: unzip is required to install Quick Test CLI (see: https://luismbaezco.github.io/quicktest/docs/getting-started/installation#unzip-is-required).
```

**When does this issue occur?**

During the `install.sh` process, `unzip` is used to extract the zip archive.

**How can this issue be fixed?**

You can install unzip via `brew install unzip` on MacOS or `apt-get install unzip -y` on Linux.
